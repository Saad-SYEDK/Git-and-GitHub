# Commands

Before we begin with commands we first have install git on our system and then we need to create a git repository and then clone the repository on our local system.

***Note:** we once we install git on local pc, we will need to configure it with user name and email we can do it using these command `git config --global user.name <your_github_user_name>` and `git config --global user.email <your_github_email>`.*

## Creating Repository

There are two ways we can create a repository, the simplest way is to create a repository on github and it will show how we can work on it on our local pc, we basically clone the repository on our local system using the `git clone <repo url>` command.

The second way is to create a repository on our local system and initialize it git using `git init` command, then we push(basically update) the repository to our cloud i.e github, if we have already configured git then we can run this commnad `git push origin main`

## Basic - add, commit, push
